# Little Lemon

This is an assignment under the Coursera Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.

The assignment is to create a home-page for one of four clients. I chose Little Lemon, a family-owned mediterranean restaurant.
Here are the grading criteria:

## Visual Layout

When viewing the home page in the browser:

- Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?
- Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?
- Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?
- Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?
- Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?
- Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?
- Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

## Semantic Structure

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

- A `header` element for the logo?
- A `nav` element for the navigation menu?
- A `main` element for the content?
- A `footer` element for the footer?
- Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as `article` and `section` in the content of the main element?

## CSS Layout, Styling, and Effects

When viewing the home page in the browser:

- Is the use of CSS styling effective?
- Is CSS used to create appropriate interactivity?

When opening the CSS file in VS Code, ask yourself the following:

- Is it a grid or flexbox layout?
- Does it have the appropriate selectors to style elements?
- Does it specify any pseudo-classes to create interactivity on the home page?
- Are any animations or transition effects used? Do they improve the user experience or distract from it?

## Overall Effect of the Home Page

- Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers?
- Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement?
- What works well?
- What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout, and visuals of the home page?

You'll also need to give feedback on and grade the assignments of two other learners using the same criteria.
